 * Simple token based thrashing protection, using the algorithm
 * described in:  http://www.cs.wm.edu/~sjiang/token.pdf
 *
 * Sep 2006, Ashwin Chaugule <ashwin.chaugule@celunite.com>
 * Improved algorithm to pass token:
 * Each task has a priority which is incremented if it contended
 * for the token in an interval less than its previous attempt.
 * If the token is acquired, that task's priority is boosted to prevent
 * the token from bouncing around too often and to let the task make
 * some progress in its execution.
